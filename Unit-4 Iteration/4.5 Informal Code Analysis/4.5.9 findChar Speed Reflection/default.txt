1. My method (findChar2) was much more efficient. I know this because from the run times we compared in the previous exercise. My method was faster than the other.

2. I think my method is more efficient because it has a smaller execution count.

3. It is important because it reduces the time needed for a program to run, and it decreases the cost.
